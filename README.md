### Features for developers

**You need to open advanced tooltip (F3+H) to use**

**Note: These keybindings can be changed in options. If set to unbind the corresponding data will be hide.**

### Known capability issues

- When some EMF resource packs installed (Such as `DetailedAnimations`), the spawn egg preview will meet some issues.
  You can close it in config.

### Developer Usage

Create a class implement `TooltipsReforgeEntrypoint`, then annotate with
`@EntryPointProvider(slug="tooltips_reforged")`(forge) or write into entrypoint `tooltips_reforged`(fabric)
